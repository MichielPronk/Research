# USE


First you have to make the script executable by downloading the script to your computer and then by changing the permission of the script in the commandline.
This is done with the following command: chmod +x extractor.sh. The script is made for a .csv file because it splits on commas.
This means that is is not compatible with other file-types. To use the on a file, type the following command in the command line: ./extractor.sh file.csv



# REPOSITORY

This repository was made to contain the shell script used to gather data for our research "Bicycle theft in student-cities." The repository only contains the shell script. The data can be accessed via the following link https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/83651NED/table?dl=344C9. It is also kept offline on a private computer.
As mentioned in the research essay, the script only works on a particular dataset, so it is most likely not compatible with other datasets.
