# USE
This shell script counts and displays the number of occurences of the word 'de' in a textfile which the user chooses.

First the user has to make the script executable by downloading the script to the computer and then by changing the permission of the script in the commandline.
This is done with the following command: chmod +x milestone5.sh

In order to input a textfile the user has to type ./milestone5.sh and the file he wants to read in the command line. 
For example, if the file we want to use is called 'test.txt' we type in the commandline: ./milestone5.sh test.txt

The script will display the number of occurences of 'de'.
